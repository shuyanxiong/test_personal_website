Multidisciplinary engineering studies have enlightened me not only with fast-learning & critical thinking skills, the capability to work across disciplines, but also strong ability to combine design issues with solid technical background. From research projects and internships, I became proficient in parametric design and optimization, energy simulation, big data and other new technologies, as well as holding hands-on experience working with additive manufacturing, structural and HVAC design. As evidenced by my experiences working as VPs in different student organizations, I'm also competent in interpersonal skills and a good team worker.
